# 21-MERN-Book-Search-Engine

    Google Books GraphQL API Challenge

## Description

This is a fully functioning Google Books API search engine that has been refactored to use a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The original application was built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) and allowed users to save book searches to the backend.
